<h1>The plan I have after highschool</h1>
<p>My plan is to go to Laurence Tech, or a different school of technology. Then graduate with a masters in five years. Once I do that I will get my real estate license, which takes only a phew months. </p>

<h4>How i'm going to persue my plan</h4>
<p>I want to go into this buisness with my brother. we are planning on going into architecture and then expanding into real estate. likly the real estate section will mostly be run by me. my hope is that I can also do this in less established places and have the rent be lower and have that money be used to buy another property. I am hoping I look to other people in this industry so that i can later do the same. </p>
